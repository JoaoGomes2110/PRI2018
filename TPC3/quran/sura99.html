         <li>When the earth is shaken with her (violent) shaking,</li>
         
         <li>And the earth brings forth her burdens,</li>
         
         <li>And man says: What has befallen her?</li>
         
         <li>On that day she shall tell her news,</li>
         
         <li>Because your Lord had inspired her.</li>
         
         <li>On that day men shall come forth in sundry bodies that they may be shown their
            works.
